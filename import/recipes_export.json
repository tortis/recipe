Micro for appr. 15\nminutes or until the color of chocolate, stirring about once a minute\nwhenever roux begins to bubble.\n\nRoux Stove: - Stir together 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of criscoe in\nlarge (iron, if have one) skillet.  Continuously stir on medium heat\nfor appr. 45 minutes until roux is chocolate color.  Continuous\nstirring is required to keep roux from sticking to bottom of skillet.\nCaution:  Do not over cook roux to black.\n\nAfter roux is chocolate color add the frozen okra (optional) to the\nroux first and stir.  Continue stirring and add the rest of the diced\nvegetables (green onion, onion, bell pepper, celery). The roux\ncontinues to cook after removing from microwave or heat so it is\nimportant to stir in the vegetables quickly to cool it down so it\nwont burn.\n\n\nWhile roux is cooking boil water with redpepper, blackpepper, salt\nand tea strainer of crabboil in a two gallon pot. Don't overboil\nwater with spices causing execessive water loss to evaporation.  If\nwater has come to a boil and roux is not ready, turn down heat and\nsimmer.  Bring water to boil again before adding roux. Add roux to\nthe boiling pot of water a little at a time till all is dissolved.\nMore water can be added to get desired consistancy.  Turn heat to\nmedium and cook until vegetables are tender - appr. 30 minutes.\nBring pot to boil again and add peeled uncooked shrimp and crab meat\nand boil for appr. 5 minutes or until shrimp are cooked. Shrimp turn\norange when done.\n\nRice: prepare as directed on bag - Bring 2 cups of water and 1 t salt\nto a boil.  After boiling add 1 cup rice and stir until mixture\nstarts to boil again.  Turn heat to low, cover pot and cook approx.\n20 minutes or until rice is dry.\n\nServe in bowl over rice with crackers.\n\nChicken and sausage gumbo:  Boil chicken in 6 quarts of water, cool\nbroth in refrigerator and skim grease off top.  Debone chicken.  Fry\n3 lbs sausage and drain off grease.  Prepare roux as before.  Use\nchicken broth to dissolve roux in.  Add chicken and sausage in place\nof shrimp.  An eight ounce can of tomato sauce can be added when\ndissolving roux in chicken broth if desired.\n\nHINTS: Have shrimp peeled and ready in advance.  Vegetables can also\nbe diced in advance.  Roux can be made in advance and refrigerated.\nUnused portions can be frozen in plastic containers.  Don't put warm\npot of Gumbo in the refrigerator - will warm up the rest of fridge.\nUse paper towl on chilled gumbo to separate and spoon off grease.\nStir well when reheating.","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6ca6"}}],"ingredients":[{"_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6ca7"},"list":[{"qty":"3","unit":"x","name":"Stalks of celery","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cb6"}},{"qty":"2","unit":"x","name":"Bunch diced green onions","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cb5"}},{"qty":"1","unit":"ea","name":"Diced bell pepper","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cb4"}},{"qty":"1","unit":"pk","name":"Frozen okra - optional *","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cb3"}},{"qty":"1","unit":"x","name":"Tea strainer - crab boil **","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cb2"}},{"qty":"1/2","unit":"x","name":"Diced medium onion","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cb1"}},{"qty":"1/8","unit":"t","name":"Red pepper","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cb0"}},{"qty":"1","unit":"t","name":"Black pepper","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6caf"}},{"qty":"5","unit":"qt","name":"Water","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cae"}},{"qty":"3","unit":"T","name":"Salt","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cad"}},{"qty":"2","unit":"c","name":"Flour","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cac"}},{"qty":"1","unit":"c","name":"Vegetable Oil","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6cab"}},{"qty":"1","unit":"c","name":"Long grain rice","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6caa"}},{"qty":"5","unit":"lb","name":"Small pealed uncooked shrimp","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6ca9"}},{"qty":"6","unit":"oz","name":"Crab meat (can)","_id":{"$oid":"565e399aca749f6f536b6ca8"}}]}],"tags":["wayne's"],"printCount":1,"dateModified":{"$date":"2015-12-02T00:21:46.560Z"},"dateCreated":{"$date":"2015-12-02T00:21:46.560Z"},"__v":0}

During this cooking\ntime, use a wooden or spaghetti spoon to lift spaghetti out of the\nwater by spoonfuls and shake strands back into the boiling water.\n(It may be an old wives' tale, but this procedure seems to enhance\nthe spaghetti's texture.)  Then immediately drain spaghetti into a\ncollander; stop cooking process by running cold water over strands.\n(If you used dry spaghetti, first rinse with hot water to wash off\nstarch.)

Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large\nroasting pan.  Then with a knife make several dozen punctures through\nthe silver skin so seasoning can permeate meat.  Pour a very generous,\neven layer of black pepper over the top of the meat (the pepper should\ncompletely cover it); repeat with the garlic powder, then the salt,\ntotally covering the preceding layer.  Carefully arrange the onions\nin an even layer on top so as not to knock off the seasoning.  Place\nthe fat cap back on top.  Refrigerate 24 hours.\nBake ribs in a 550F oven until the fat is dark brown and crispy on\ntop, about 35 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool slightly.\nRefrigerate until well chilled, about 3 hours.  (this is done so the\njuices will solidify and the steaks can be cooked rare.)  Remove fat\ncap and disgard.  With the blade of a large knife, scrape off the\nonions and as much of the seasonings as possible and discard.  Then\nwith a long knife, slice between ribs into 6 steaks (4 will have\nbones); trim the cooked surface of meat from the 2 pieces that were\non the outside of the roast.  Season and cook in your favorite way\nfor steaks. TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS:  Combine the ingredients of the\nseasoning mix thoroughly in a small bowl; you will have about 8\ntablespoons. Sprinkle the steaks generously and evenly on both sides\nwith the mix. using about 4 teaspoons on each steak and pressing it\nin with your hands.\nHeat a cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the\nsmoking stage and you see white ash on the skillet bottom--at least\n10 minutes.  (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.)  Place\none steak in the hot skillet (cook only one side at a time) and cook\nover a very high heat until the underside starts to develop a heavy,\nblack crust, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn the steak over and cook until\nthe underside is crusted like the first, about 2 to 3 minutes more.\nRepeat with the remaining steaks.  Serve each steak while piping hot.\n(*NOTE*:  If you don't have a commercial hood vent over your stove,\nthis dish may smoke you out of the kitchen.  It's worth it!  But you\ncan also cook it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get\nhot enough to \"blacken\" the steak properly.  If you have a smoke\ndetector in your house, you will be able to determine if it is working\ncorrectly.  This is NOT a dish to prepare in an apartment building\nwith a central fire alarm system wired into your smoke detector.  It\ncauses great excitement!  Also, you can be guaranteed you will meet\nyour landlord.)\nFrom Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f3e"}}],"ingredients":[{"_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f46"},"list":[{"qty":"4","unit":"lb","name":"Prime rib roast (10-1/2 lbs)","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f4b"}},{"qty":"1/4","unit":"c","name":"Black pepper","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f4a"}},{"qty":"1/4","unit":"c","name":"Garlic powder","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f49"}},{"qty":"1/4","unit":"c","name":"Salt","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f48"}},{"qty":"2","unit":"ea","name":"Onions, thinly sliced","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f47"}}]},{"name":"SEASONING MIX (OPTIONAL","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f3f"},"list":[{"qty":"1","unit":"T","name":"Plus 1 tsp, salt","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f45"}},{"qty":"1","unit":"T","name":"Plus 2 tsp, white pepper","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f44"}},{"qty":"1","unit":"T","name":"Plus 2 tsp, fennel seeds","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f43"}},{"qty":"1","unit":"T","name":"Plus 3/4 tsp, black pepper","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f42"}},{"qty":"2 1/2","unit":"t","name":"Dry mustard","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f41"}},{"qty":"2 1/2","unit":"t","name":"Ground cayenne pepper","_id":{"$oid":"565e39f0ca749f6f536b7f40"}}]}],"tags":["main dish","meats"],"printCount":1,"dateModified":{"$date":"2015-12-02T00:23:12.597Z"},"dateCreated":{"$date":"2015-12-02T00:23:12.597Z"},"__v":0}

It is cured\nwith salt and is not smoked.  It comes rolled up like a large\nsalami.  Widely used in Italian cooking, especially in Emilia-Romagna,\nit is vital to many dishes.  If available, buy a large quantity.\nCut into several pieces and freeze it.  You can substitute domestic\nbacon for pancetta.  It must be blanched in boiling water for two\nthree minutes to reduce the smoky flavour.  Fresh side pork can also\nbe used.  I'll be posting several recipes over the next while that\ncall for pancetta, so if you can find some, it won't go to waste.\nPrepare chicken broth (see my previously posted recipe).  Heat oil\nin a large saucepan.  Add parsley and garlic.  Saute over medium\nheat.  Before garlic changes colour, add pancetta.  Saute until\nlightly browned.  Stir in cabbage.  Cover and cook 1 to 2 minutes.\nAdd remaining vegetables to saucepan.  Cover and cook about 5\nminutes.  Add broth and water, if using, and prosciutto rind or ham\nshank.  Cover and reduce heat.  Simmer 40 to 50 minutes.  Remove\nhalf the vegetables with a slotted spoon.  Place in a blender or\nfood processor and process until smooth.  Return to saucepan.\nSeason with salt and pepper.
